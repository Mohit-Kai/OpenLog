# OpenLog


OpenLog is a compact serial data logger built around the ATmega328 microcontroller. It automatically records incoming serial data to a microSD card, supporting baud rates up to 115200 bps. Configuration is handled through a simple text file stored on the card. This makes OpenLog an effective solution for sensor data logging, system monitoring, and remote debugging applications.
